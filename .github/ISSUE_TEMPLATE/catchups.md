A few questions to cover on a Catchup:

- What's on your mind?
- How has the previous week of work been for you? Are there any blockers we can discuss or remove?
- How do you feel about your workload? (high, low, or just right)
- Do you feel there is enough feedback about your work?
- How can I help you ...? (be more productive/happier at work/enjoy work more/etc.)
- Are there any meetings or discussions you feel you should be a part of that you're not? Are you included in any you don't want to be a part of?
- Do you have any half-baked ideas for projects, the company or anything else?

Refer to [the Handbook for additional questions](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook/blob/master/5_People/catchups.md).
