# Niteo Career

For every Nitean we create a repository like this one, named `niteo-career-<handle>` to have a single point of reference for their career in Niteo.

The Nitean gets `Admin` permissions over the repo and Partners get `read/write` permissions. The Nitean's mentor also gets `read/write` permissions. Anyone else can not read the repo.

The reason we do it like this is that the repository might contain personal information and we want every Nitean to be the master of their personal information. If they leave Niteo, they have the power to remove the repo and nobody can read it any more. It also gives Niteans clarity into who exactly can read the Catchups notes: only the people listed as collaborators to the repo.

The repo is used to store career-related notes:
* [Career Path](https://github.com/niteoweb/niteo-career/issues/1): Every time you have a Catchup, you or your senior write a report in this issue.
* [Catchups](https://github.com/niteoweb/niteo-career/issues/2): Every time your have a Catchup, you talk about the weeks since the last Catchup and highlight accomplishments in this issue and recognize the steps required to progress to the next level.
